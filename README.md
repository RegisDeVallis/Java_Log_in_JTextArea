Java_Log_in_JTextArea
=====================

This will set it so that you can display the Java log in a JTextArea. It will also automatically update the JTextArea. This is 
useful. I used/and created it for a console/text based program I made and it was using the Netbeans console. I wanted a GUI for it
and this did the trick. It works across all situations and across different files, so you dont have to do the trick for each file 
you create. Have fun :)
